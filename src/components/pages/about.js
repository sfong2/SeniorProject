   <h3><b>Website Goal</b></h3>
    <h4>    The goal of this tool is to help the seller reduce the cost of advertisement 
      by filtering out keywords that may be counterproductive for the sellersâ€™ market. Through 
      data mining the website will display the data in a readable table as well as display in 
      three different graphs for clearer understanding. 
    </h4>
    <h3><b>Brief Explanation</b></h3>
     <h4>   The website depends on multiple algorithms, databases, data structures, and programming 
      languages that monitor the keywords to increase search efficiency and display what the customers
      most search.
